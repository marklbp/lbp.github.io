problem:
Command failed: execvp(): No such file or directory

answer:
I met the same problem...
At last, I found the reason of that is node-imagemagick depend on the imagemagick module, unfortunately, this module is not installed in my system.
My system is Ubuntu. just run the following command.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing
